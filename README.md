# Project_Novel_Drug_Target_for_Eumycetoma

Mycetoma is a neglected tropical disease (NTDs) caused by fungi (eumycetoma) or bacteria (actinomycetoma), which is common in tropical regions. It is characterized by a large subcutaneous mass, which results in tumorous lesions on mainly the feet. The micro-organisms organize themselves in the grains which is characteristic for mycetoma.  


The most common causative of the mycetoma is the actinomycetoma, which can be treated easily. But treatment of eumycetoma with antifungal drugs is only successful in less than 30% of the patients. Treatment involves prolonged use of medications and often results in amputation of the affected area. Due to protective grains, penetration with antifungal agent sometimes doesnâ€™t work. Therefore, there is an urgent need in finding an effective, safe and affordable antifungal agent.  

The mycetoma OpenSource drugs discovery demonstrated that the fernarimol compounds were already potent inhibitors of M. mycetomatis growt. However not all compounds were able to penetrate the grains. Therefore, additional fenarmol compounds are being screened to determine the for penetrating the mycetoma grains.  

The aim of this study is to identify the mode of action of the compounds able to inhibit M. mycetomatis in vitro examined.
